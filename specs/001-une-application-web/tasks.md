# Tasks: Multilingual Text-to-Speech Web Application

Feature Directory: /specs/001-une-application-web

## Setup Tasks
- [ ] T001: Initialize project structure (src/, tests/, contracts/, manifest, service worker)
- [ ] T002: Set up basic HTML/CSS/JS files for static app
- [ ] T003: Configure PWA manifest and service worker for offline support

## Test Tasks [P]
- [ ] T004: automated tests for language detection (French, English, Spanish)
- [ ] T005: Write tests for speech synthesis (masculine/feminine voice selection)
- [ ] T006: Write tests for text length validation (â‰¤ 500 words)
- [ ] T007: Write tests for UI feedback (highlighting during speech)

## Core Tasks
- [ ] T008: Implement text input and validation logic
- [ ] T009: Implement language detection algorithm (JS, no external API)
- [ ] T010: Implement percentage display for detected languages
- [ ] T011: Implement blocking logic if dominant language < 50%
- [ ] T012: Implement blocking logic if text > 500 words
- [ ] T013: Implement speech synthesis using SpeechSynthesis API
- [ ] T014: Implement voice selection (masculine/feminine)
- [ ] T015: Implement UI feedback (highlighting text during speech)

## Integration Tasks
- [ ] T016: Integrate service worker for offline capability
- [ ] T017: Integrate manifest for PWA installation

## Polish Tasks [P]
- [ ] T018: Add unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] T019: Add integration tests for user scenarios
- [ ] T020: Write documentation (quickstart, usage, limitations)
- [ ] T021: Review code for constitution compliance
- [ ] T022: Finalize and polish UI/UX

## Parallel Execution Guidance
- Tasks marked [P] (T004, T005, T006, T007, T018, T019, T020, T021, T022) can be executed in parallel.
- Setup tasks (T001-T003) must be completed first.
- Core tasks (T008-T015) depend on setup and test tasks.
- Integration tasks (T016-T017) depend on core tasks.
- Polish tasks can be run after integration.

## Dependency Notes
- All tasks are numbered and ordered by dependency.
- Parallel tasks are grouped for efficiency.
